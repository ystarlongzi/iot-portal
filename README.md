IoT Portal（SaaS 开发框架前端项目）
===

English | [中文版](README_zh.md)

The SaaS development framework is a front-end and back-end open source framework provided by Tuya for IoT SaaS developers. The framework is fully developed based on [Tuya OpenAPI](https://developer.tuya.com/en/docs/cloud) and integrates basic functions such as user login, role permissions, device management, and device control necessary for IoT SaaS. It also provides a React-based front-end UI interface ([Ant.Design](https://ant.design/)). Developers only need to do simple secondary development based on the source code, and they can quickly put it into use.


## Features

- 📦 Using the [qiankun](https://qiankun.umijs.org/zh/guide) framework to build and introduce a micro front-end architecture;
- 📱 Out of the box. Provides complete development tools; also built-in application management, permission management, device management, asset management and other basic micro-applications;
- 🌍 Support for multiple languages, with both Chinese and English available by default;
- 🦾 Optimized for secondary development: You can extend existing functions through micro-applications, and also support secondary development of built-in functions to meet specific business needs;
- 💡 Optimized for IoT environments. Based on the Tuya cloud platform and designed for IoT-type applications;
- 💼 Use yarn workspaces to manage packages of multi-apps.
